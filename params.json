I wanted the manifest\r\nto be the sole source of truth for that information, but I also wanted to\r\nprint it when invoking `java -jar myjar.jar --version`. This code isn't unique\r\nto my application, so here it is as a reusable jar.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2015 Steve Hill\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
